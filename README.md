- This is a web based chat bot that will run different queries about music based on the user's request
- Also it will have the function to recommend music based on the user's taste in music
- This will be done by utilizing the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) and [Spotify account integration](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
